# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

### Dataset
The [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. The dataset is commonly used for benchmarking image classification models.
